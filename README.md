# 🧠 Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

## 🎯 Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify patterns, correlations, and key factors affecting passenger survival.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Files Included
- `Titanic_eda.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook with code and visualizations
- `tested.csv` – Dataset used for analysis
- `EDA_Report.pdf` – PDF summary of findings
- `README.md` – This file

## 📊 Key Steps
1. **Import Libraries**  
2. **Load Dataset**  
3. **Handle Missing Values**  
4. **Explore Data using .describe() and .info()**  
5. **Visualize Relationships (pairplot, heatmap, boxplot, histogram)**  
6. **Summarize Key Insights**

## 📝 Summary of Findings
- Younger passengers and females had higher survival chances.  
- Higher-class (1st class) passengers survived more often.  
- Embarked location influenced survival rate slightly.
